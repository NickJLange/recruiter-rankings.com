## Right-of-reply
Verified recruiters may respond to reviews. We aim to review responses within 7 days to minimize slander risk when feasible.

## Takedown policy
Default to takedown to reduce risk during the POC. SLA: 7 days standard, 3 days urgent.

## Compliance scope (POC)
- GDPR baseline (US launch); basic CCPA/CPRA handling for access/deletion on request
- Data subject requests: email-based, verify requester identity, log actions

## Anti-abuse
- ≤ 10 reviews/account/24h; minimum account age 24h
- IP/UA rate limits; high-similarity text detection

## Public aggregates
- Suppress aggregates until k-anonymity threshold (e.g., n ≥ 5 reviews)
